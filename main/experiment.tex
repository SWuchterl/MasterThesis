\chapter{The Experiment}\label{chap:experiment}
In this chapter, the relevant experimental setup is explained. Starting with the description of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is responsible for the acceleration of the proton beams, after that the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment and detector with all important subdetector components is explained.
\section{The large hadron collider}\label{sec:LHC}
The Large Hadron Collider~\cite{LHC1,LHC2}, located at the European Organization of Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva in Switzerland, is the worlds largest hadron collider. The design center-of-mass energy for the proton-proton collisions is $\sqrt{s}=14\TeV$, while the LHC started operating in 2010 with an energy of $7\TeV$. After running also in 2011 at $7\TeV$, the energy was increased for the 2012 run period to $8\TeV$. After that, the end of RunI, and after the first long shutdown, the LHC started running again in 2015 with an increased center-of-mass energy of $13\TeV$. This setup was maintained trough the whole RunII until the end of 2018. In the following, the LHC will be upgraded again in the long shutdown II, so that with the beginning of 2021 it is planned to start operating with the design energy of $14\TeV$.
In addition the LHC is capable of accelerating lead ions with an energy of $2.76\TeV$ per nucleon.\\
The LHC is a synchroton collider built in a tunnel with a circumference of $27\km$, which was already used for the Large Electron Positron collider (LEP)~\cite{LEPCollider} in the past. The proton beams are accelerated using various preacceleators, such as the Booster, Proton Synchroton (PS), and the Super Proton Synchroton (SPS), delivering an proton energy of $450\GeV$ before entering the main storage ring. Four main experiments are located at the LHC, each built around one of the four collisions points. These namely are: CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid)~\cite{CMS}, ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus)~\cite{ATLAS}, ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment)~\cite{ATLAS}, and LHCb (LHC Beauty)~\cite{LHCb}. CMS and ATLAS were designed to be independent experiments looking both for BSM physics, measure precisely properties of the SM, and improve the knowledge on the Higgs sector. Besides those tasks, they also analyze lead ion collisions to gain a deeper understanding of the strong interaction. The tasks of ALICE include studies on the quark-gluon-plasma, where the confinement is abrogated, leading to asymptotically free quarks and gluons. Lastly LHCb investigates mainly mesons, that include charm and bottom quarks, to perform precision measurements of the SM and indirectly look for $\mathcal{CP}$-violation and hints for new physics.
